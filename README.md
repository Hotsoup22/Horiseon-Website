## Refactor Horiseon
00 ticket number. intstructions were to refactor code.
- while working I discovered the webpage was out of date,when it came to modern semantic orders.
- I saw duplicates in the css stlye sheet, recategorized under 1 class, instead of multiple lines duplicateing eachother.
- elemnts in css where also out of semantic order.
- divs were overly used, so they were replaced with the correct semantic element tag.
- visually the code was hard to read, so i added comments to help give structure to the eye.
code is never perfect, but the goal was to make this semanticly correct, while improving the site's performance.
